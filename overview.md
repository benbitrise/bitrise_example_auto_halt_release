# Overview

Back in the old days, I would publish a new version of my app to the App Store or Play Store using the phased rollout. Over the next few days, I would have to periodically check the crash rate and other SLOs. If there was a show-stopper problem that couldn't be addressed with remote config, I would halt the release and get to work on a hotfix. 

This gist explains how you can automate this effort. It means faster time to detection and less toil.
